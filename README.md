# introduction-to-r-part4

This is a single file stand-alone application using R Markdown.
It requires the reshape2 package.

It was run and tested using RStudio and the knitr package.

Use the file with the .Rmd extension as input, or examine the
file with the .html extension to see what the output is like.

All of the data files are available through the Internet, but
for your convenience, I am including copies of them in this
repository. I also stored the data in binary format in the
part3.RData file.

This application does not need any special files beyond the
ones listed above.
